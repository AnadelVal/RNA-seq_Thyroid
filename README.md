# RNA-seq_Thyroid

It consists on the differential expression analysis, comparing 3 type of Group samples:
• NIT-SFI
• NIT-ELI
• SFI-ELI

The dataset for the exercise comes from the repository GTEx and has been provided by UOC. This repository
contains data of multiple types out of 54 tissues. We focus on RNA-seq expression data of a thyroid analysis, where
3 type of infiltration is compared in 292 samples.
The distribution of the samples is the following: 
- Not infiltrated tissues (NIT): 236 samples 
- Small focal infiltrates (SFI): 42 samples 
- Extensive lymphoid infiltrates (ELI): 14 samples
